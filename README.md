Faucetpump is a pump for cryptocurrency faucets.

It's more an excercise in automating lots of websites constantly and breaking captchas than an actual money-making scheme.
To defeat ratelimiting and cooldowns Tor recircuiting will be implemented.
For those faucets requiring followups we'll implement VPN switching.
